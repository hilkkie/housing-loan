Analysis on interest rate costs related to housing loans with Euribor base rate.

The data applied in the analysis constitutes of average monthly observations of Euribor interest rates since 1994. The data can be downloaded from the statistical data warehouse of European Central Bank for each Euribor rate separately. For each interest rate, the data should be stored as a csv file with columns Date, Euribor``<tenor>``M, Status and Comment to folder ``data`` with name ``euribor_<tenor>m_data.csv``, where ``<tenor>`` is the tenor of the respective interest rate. In order to analyse housing loans, the parameters of the loans should be represented as a csv file ``loan_parameters.csv`` with columns for principal, marginal, interest rate, maturity of the loan and reset frequency of the interest rate inside folder ``data``. The name of the interest rate should be written in the same format as the in the data file columns.
